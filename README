#build and run standalone demo.
mvnw package && java -jar target/savings-gateway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

#build the docker image for demo
docker build -t demo/savings-gateway .

#start dockers. set hostname to where savings services are running. set to wrong host to test timeout.
docker run  -e "service.savings.hostname=http://192.168.0.103" -p 8080:8080 demo/savings-gateway
